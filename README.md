## Notes

### Initial Setup

- Setup React-Router-DOM for your pages (e.g. Home, Pokedex).
  - The home page will contain the label art/name for each generation, as well as one general label that would contain all gens.
  - Clicking on a generation will direct you to the Pokedex page, generating the pokedex based on the pokemon generation selected by the user.
  - On the home page, include a 'carousel' type function that is called whenever a user hovers on a generation. When hovering on a select generation, showcase random pokemon from that generation. When a user is not hovering on a select generation, showcase random pokemon from all generations.
- Create Header & Footer components.
